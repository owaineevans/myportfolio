Flutter app attempt at animating a top bar by moving text.

To see the simple animation move the Book appointments.

Ended up putting all the animation into the layout which makes changing opacity and font sizes difficult - will have to come back and work out how to work with that.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo.

Run `flutter packages get` followed by `flutter run`
